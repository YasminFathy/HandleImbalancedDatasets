- **1_DataExploration.ipynb**: is to explore Scania Dataset, impute the missing values and apply dimensionality reduction

- **2_PredictiveModels_NoPCA.ipynb**: predict failure (logistic regression, XGBoost, Random Forest) using Scania Dataset (including imputing the missing values without dimensionality reduction)
